# `xdash`: Python SDK & CLI for XMC Metrics Dashboards

`xdash` is a Python SDK and command-line interface (CLI) for creating, retrieving, and inspecting XMC Metrics Dashboards and Charts. It provides a gRPC client to communicate with the XMC Dashboard Service.

## Installation / Usage in Bazel

To depend on `xdash` in Bazel Python rules, add:

```python
deps = [
    "//sdks/python/xdash",
]
```

## Python SDK Examples

### Reading Dashboards and Charts

`DashboardClient` wraps the DashboardService read RPCs. It owns its gRPC channel, so use it as a
context manager to release the connection deterministically:

```python
from xdash import DashboardClient

with DashboardClient(endpoint="localhost:8080") as client:
    for dashboard in client.list_dashboards():
        print(f"{dashboard.name}: {dashboard.title}")

    dashboard = client.get_dashboard("dashboards/vcc_comparison")
    chart = client.get_chart("experiments/234911122/workUnits/1/charts/baseline")
    print(f"{chart.title} has {len(chart.plots)} plots")
```

The endpoint defaults to the `XMC_DASHBOARD_ENDPOINT` environment variable, falling back to
`localhost:8080`.

## CLI Usage (`xdash`)

You can run `xdash` directly via Bazel or as a Python module:

```bash
# List every dashboard known to the service
bazel run //sdks/python/xdash:xdash_bin -- list

# Retrieve an existing dashboard
bazel run //sdks/python/xdash:xdash_bin -- get dashboards/vcc_comparison

# Retrieve a single chart (any of the three chart resource patterns works)
bazel run //sdks/python/xdash:xdash_bin -- get experiments/234911122/workUnits/1/charts/baseline
```
